# Atom Panels

I wasn't happy with the way Atom was handling split views, especially in Vim Mode, so I made my own. It's essentially just a few keyboard shortcuts to navigate between split panes and create new ones in each direction.

This package may actually be doable using default Atom functionality, but I wasn't aware of it at the time and I wanted an excuse to learn coffeescript :)
